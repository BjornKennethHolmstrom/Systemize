              Picture yourself looking at an ocean. You can focus on individual waves—their height, 
              their motion, their interaction. Or you can expand your awareness to see the entire 
              ocean, where waves are inseparable expressions of a single body of water. Both views 
              are true, both are useful, and together they offer a complete understanding of the 
              ocean&apos;s nature.

            <p>
              Our minds naturally divide the world into dualities: self and other, good and bad, 
              right and wrong, subject and object. This splitting helps us navigate daily life and 
              make practical decisions. It&apos;s like having a map that divides a city into districts—
              useful for navigation, but the divisions themselves are conceptual overlays rather 
              than physical barriers.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Common Dualities We Navigate:</h3>

              Non-duality doesn&apos;t reject these useful distinctions. Instead, it reveals a deeper 
              reality where apparent opposites are actually complementary aspects of a unified 
              whole. Like discovering that particles and waves are different expressions of the 
              same quantum reality, or that space and objects define each other, non-dual 
              awareness shows us the underlying unity of experience.

            <blockquote className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-500 p-4 my-8 rounded-r-lg italic">
              Try to find exactly where your body ends and the environment begins—is the air in 
              your lungs you or not-you? Where does one ecosystem end and another begin? The more 
              closely we look, the more we see that boundaries are convenient conventions rather 
              than absolute realities.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Non-dual awareness often emerges naturally as we develop broader perspectives. A 
              child might see their family and other families as separate units, but growing up 
              reveals how all families are interconnected within the larger community. A scientist 
              might start by studying isolated phenomena, only to discover that everything affects 
              everything else in an inseparable web of relationships.

                <li>Honoring individual uniqueness while recognizing fundamental interconnectedness</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Systems View of Non-Duality</h2>
            
            <p>
              Modern systems thinking offers fascinating parallels to ancient non-dual wisdom. Both 
              recognize that everything exists in context, that separation is relative rather than 
              absolute, and that parts and whole arise together. A systems view shows us how every 
              element exists within multiple overlapping contexts, just as non-dual understanding 
              reveals how all experiences arise within consciousness itself.
            </p>

            <blockquote className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-500 p-4 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
              Consider how an ecosystem functions. Each organism appears separate, yet none can 
              exist in isolation. The boundary between organism and environment is functional 
              rather than absolute. The health of any part depends on the health of the whole, 
              and the whole emerges from the harmonious interaction of all parts.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Different Levels of Truth</h2>
            
            <p>
              Rather than seeing dual and non-dual perspectives as contradictory, we can 
              understand them as operating at different levels of truth. Relative truth deals 
              with the world of distinctions, measurements, and practical operations. Absolute 
              truth points to the underlying unity from which all distinctions emerge. Both are 
              valid in their domain, like how Newtonian physics works perfectly for everyday 
              objects even though quantum mechanics reveals a deeper reality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Living the Integration</h2>
            
            <p>
              In practice, integrating dual and non-dual understanding leads to a more balanced, 
              effective way of living. We can fully engage in activities while maintaining spacious 
              awareness. We can work toward goals without being trapped in outcome-fixation. We 
              can honor differences while recognizing underlying unity. We can be both human and 
              aware of our deeper nature.

            <p>
              Understanding non-duality isn&apos;t about reaching a final destination—it&apos;s an ongoing 
              exploration that continually reveals new depths. Each insight leads to new questions, 
              each understanding opens new horizons. The journey itself is an expression of the 
              dance between the relative and absolute, between exploration and realization, 
              between being and becoming.
